Description: We study the relationship between function and structure in the V1DD dataset by examining how cell ensembles differ across conditions and what structural motifs or correlates underlie their organization.

Dataset Used: V1 Deep Dive (V1DD). Single cell activity measured across a cubic millimeter of the mouse visual cortex while the animal is headfixed and exposed to a variety of visual cues including gratings, low sparse noise , natural images and movies.
